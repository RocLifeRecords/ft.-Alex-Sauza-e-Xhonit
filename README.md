The music video for "Sauza e Xhonit." The photo is a shooter in the house of my cousin Xhoni. So I have made this video with artwork.
Reception



These days the quarters are the most place where the people have security. Xhoni is my cousin, and he lived in Tirana; Albania in the most listened to quarter Ali Demi where I live 20 years. I have longing in myself, and I decide to do this song and to dedicate also to my old quarter. In the song I put some elements of the medieval writings of the most famous humanist Gjon Buzuku on the grounds. In the song is the "baptismal spelling"' because Gjon Buzuku said to all Albanian people that time to go in church, to learn more about the scripts.
